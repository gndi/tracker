# Tracker 

An open source management and notifications system for Covid-19 (and crisis management in general.)

It came with GIS built in support, and it can help in:

- tracking issues (covid-19 cases)
- (private) user's submissions
- assign cases to quarantines
- site selections for quarantines (currently that is a preprocessing step)
- quarantine management system, including:
    - quarantine location
    - quarantine profile
    - quarantine admin
    - quarantine reports
    - quarantine status
    and more
