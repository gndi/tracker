# Tracker 

An open source management and notifications system for Covid-19 (and crisis management in general.)

It came with GIS built in support, and it can help in:

- tracking issues (covid-19 cases)
- (private) user's submissions
- assign cases to quarantines
- site selections for quarantines (currently that is a preprocessing step)
- quarantine management system, including:
    - quarantine location
    - quarantine profile
    - quarantine admin
    - quarantine reports
    - quarantine status
    and more
- quarantines (sites management):

    - team members per quarantine
    - assign tasks to team members
    - assign project manager to quarantine
    - progress reports by team members
    - tasks view and outstanding issues

This all comes with a powerful query language.

## Case studies

- This work is currently used by the ministry of health and infrastructure in Sudan to monitor and track Covid-19 cases
- It is also used in Yemen (the original author Mohamed Mahmoud is Yemeni and he helped porting Tracker to be used in Yemen.)
